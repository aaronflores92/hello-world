My name is Aaron Flores. I am a Software Engineering professional who is looking to become employed in the Software Engieering field. 
I have several hobies that I like to maintain after work, such as going for runs, exercising at the gym, eating delicious foods, and watching anime and movies on Netflix. I also enjoy a great pickup game of soccer!
